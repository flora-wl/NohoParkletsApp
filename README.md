# NohoParkletsApp
This application helps ease the communication between the city of Northampton and its community members by allowing direct visualization of projects through augmented reality.

NohoParklets is built on top of ARSimpleNativeCars, an ARToolkit example, to allow easier use and change of augmented reality assets files.
